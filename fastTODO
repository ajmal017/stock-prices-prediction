- create tests for sin,cos including 1s,1m,2m,5m (open,close,high,low,volume)
- make call to beautiful soup every 1s, in the rest of the time - train
- make plotutil (callback) work with all time_scales and not just 1s, as well on MANY2MANY
- find optimal window_size (hyper parameter) - train the same model with various window_sizes and pick the one the reaches the minimal validation loss for each time frame (1m,2m,5m,...)
- create platform that adds a prediction to the stock prices
- add storage service to store the models - already created train model API
- create third party test for callback_test(wandb,neptune) and graphs(request.get())
