- check out if perceptron MANY2ONE/MANY2MANY works on real stocks
- add RNN MANY2ONE/MANY2MANY
- find optimal window_size (hyper parameter) - train the same model with various window_sizes and pick the one the reaches the minimal validation loss
this has to be done for the following time scales:
    * tick
    * 1 minute
    * 5 minutes
    * 10 minutes
    * 15 minutes
    * 30 minutes
    * 1 H
    * 1 D
    * 5 D
    * 1 W
    * 1 M
    * 3 M
    * 6 M
    * 1 Y
    * 2 Y
    * 5 Y
    * MAX



- create platform that adds a prediction ot the stock prices
- add storage service to store the models
- create third party test for callback_test(wandb,neptune) and graphs(request.get())
- create dataset_test.py
