- check out if perceptron MANY2ONE/MANY2MANY works on real stocks
- add RNN MANY2ONE/MANY2MANY
- think about a smarter way to save values in queue - not just 'close' value
- create 5 model predictions (open,low,high,close, volume) for each time frame (1m,2m,5m,...) for a given window_size - save 1 model, vector of five elements.
- find optimal window_size (hyper parameter) - train the same model with various window_sizes and pick the one the reaches the minimal validation loss for each time frame (1m,2m,5m,...)
- create platform that adds a prediction to the stock prices
- add storage service to store the models - already created train model API
- create third party test for callback_test(wandb,neptune) and graphs(request.get())
- create dataset_test.pybuild_nodes_small.sh
run_nodes_small.sh
